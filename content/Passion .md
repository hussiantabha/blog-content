One thing common about bill gates, steve jobs, and Elon musk Zuckerberg is the passion they have for what they work on. In bills documentary, he says that he would code for almost the day and sleep. Just the two things about how Microsoft was born. 

The conclusion is that work on what you are passionate about because the science behind it is that you would not get bored out of it — somebody wouldn’t force you to do it like your boss sitting on your head bugging every hour to send in your work. When you are passionate about work you work for yourself you enjoy working. You look forward to the excitement and the thrill of exploring deeper into the work. 

My, only wish is that I would work for my passion & nothing else. But the counterargument here is that eventually, you will get bored. Not in a year but in a long-term of 7-10 years. In that time things would be built massively considering you work day & night. You would not get bored with the core subject but the things revolving around that suppose your passion is to build cars but in order to survive you have to make money by selling on what you create — the car. You like to build cars but you don’t like to arrange for vendors not like to see the supply chain not like to see the business side of it. It can be the literal opposite too you like the business side of it you are excited to see it grow. You would like to involve in making this a huge success. 

Ultimately you work for passion.
